# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- Fork crc-32 1.2.2 under the `@stackline` scope; retain its Apache-2.0 license and API.
- The `str` function encodes unpaired UTF-16 surrogates as U+FFFD, matching standard UTF-8 encoders. Valid strings, byte inputs, signed results, and seed behavior are preserved.
- Replace obsolete test dependencies with Mocha 12 and a locked, audited development install.
- Build the original source fragments with Node.js and validate declaration usage with current TypeScript; remove unused legacy coverage, minifier, codepage and type-checking dependencies.
